Absolutely! Here's a general rulebook üß† for handling string DP problems, especially when applying tabulation and space optimization.

üîÅ General Rule for String DP ‚Äî Tabulation & Space Optimization
üß± 1. DP Table Meaning
For any DP problem on strings:

cpp
Copy
Edit
dp[i][j] = answer for first i characters of string1 and first j characters of string2
That means:

i = 0 ‚Üí empty prefix of string1

j = 0 ‚Üí empty prefix of string2

So table size should be dp[n+1][m+1] for strings of length n and m

üìê 2. Dimensions of the Table (Tabulation)
What You're Storing	Table Size
dp[i][j] where i is from s1	(s1.length() + 1) rows
j is from s2	(s2.length() + 1) columns

üßÆ 3. Base Cases
Always initialize:

dp[0][j] ‚Üí comparing empty s1 to s2[0..j-1]

dp[i][0] ‚Üí comparing s1[0..i-1] to empty s2

‚ôªÔ∏è 4. Space Optimization Rule
In space-optimized DP:

Keep only 2 rows: prev[] and curr[]

Size of these arrays should be based on the inner loop string

‚úÖ Rule:
Inner loop variable	Array size for prev[] & curr[]
j over s2	s2.length() + 1
j over s1	s1.length() + 1

‚úîÔ∏è Because curr[j] and prev[j] track the current and previous row/column values.

‚úÖ 5. Final Result Location
Problem Type	Final DP Cell
LCS / Edit Distance	dp[n][m]
Substring Match	Often max(dp[i][j]) over the grid
Count Ways (like subsequences)	dp[n][m]

üîß Example-Based Summary
Problem Type	Outer Loop	Inner Loop	Array Size in Space Optimized
Edit Distance	i over s1	j over s2	m + 1 (length of s2)
LCS (Longest Common Subsequence)	i over s1	j over s2	m + 1
Longest Palindromic Subsequence	i over s1	j over s1 (reverse)	n + 1
Subset Sum / Count Subsequences	i over nums	j over sum/target	depends on inner

üß† Mnemonic
"Size the row by the outer loop, and the array by the inner loop."

In space optimization, always match array size to the variable changing in the inner loop, because that‚Äôs where the indices (curr[j], prev[j]) are accessed.
