// Strongly Connected Components(only for directed graphs)
// Kosaraju's Algorithm
//it is a directed graph algorithm that finds the strongly connected components of a directed graph.
// A strongly connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a maximal strongly connected subgraph.
// A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path from any vertex to every other vertex.
//scc means that there is a path from any vertex to every other vertex in the component.


//Baiscally we have to do :
// 1. Do a DFS on the original graph to get the finishing times of each vertex.
// 2. Reverse the graph.
// 3. Do a DFS on the reversed graph in the order of decreasing finishing times.
// 4. Each time we finish a DFS, we have found a strongly connected component.
// 5. Repeat until all vertices are visited.

// Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
// Space Complexity: O(V + E) for the graph and the stack used in DFS
// Note: This algorithm is not suitable for undirected graphs, as it will not find all the connected components.
